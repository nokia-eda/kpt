              APIVersion defines the versioned schema of this representation of an object.
              Servers should convert recognized schemas to the latest internal value, and

              Deviations are used to represent differences between the intended and actual state of a target.
              They indicate the intended state - or the computed configuration EDA expects, and compare this to the actual or running state, or the configuration retrieved from the target.
              Deviations are most often generated by out-of-band changes to a target by an external system or user, and
              can be accepted or rejected. Rejecting a Deviation will result in the intended configuration being re-applied, undoing the out-of-band change.
              Deviations are raised per table, meaning a single change on a target may result in more than one Deviation.
