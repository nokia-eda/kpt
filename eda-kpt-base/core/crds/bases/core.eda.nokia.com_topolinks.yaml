              TopoLink represents a logical link between two TopoNodes. It may include more than one physical link, being used to represent a LAG or multihomed link.
              To create a point to point link with a single interface on both sides use a single link property.
              To create a point to point link with a LAG configured on both side, use two links with matching nodes.
              A multihomed LAG is created by using two or more links where the A side and/or B side can be different.
              Creating a link with only A specified will create an edge interface.
