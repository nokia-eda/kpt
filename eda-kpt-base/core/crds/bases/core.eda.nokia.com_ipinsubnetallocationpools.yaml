            description: IPInSubnetAllocationPool is a generic IP allocation pool supporting allocation of IPv4 and/or IPv6 addresses from a set of segments. It is different from IPAllocationPool in that it returns a single zoned IP address, i.e. an IP address with a subnet. For example a 10.1.1.0/24 segment could return 10.1.1.1/24. Consult application documentation to know which pool type to use for a given use case.
