              SubnetAllocationPool is a generic subnet allocation pool supporting allocation of IPv4 and/or IPv6 child subnets from a list of parent subnet segments.
              It allocates a subnet of the configured length from the provided parent subnet.
              For example a pool could return 10.1.0.8/29 when a segment is defined as subnet 10.1.0.0/16 with subnet length 29.
              Consult application documentation to know which pool type to use for a given use case.
